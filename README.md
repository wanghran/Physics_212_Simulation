# Physics_212_Simulation

## Project brief

1. Car price simulation. 
2. Dynamic model for a driven double pendulum
3. Simulating rocket trajectory and using linear regression to curve fit a data of rocket position
4. Forcasting forest fire and simulating its spreading
5. Simulating heat dissipation and compare the sequential computing vs. parallel computing.
